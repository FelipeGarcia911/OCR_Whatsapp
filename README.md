### General Description
I am using OCR to extract text from images and then filter it to look for interesting words. I was helping to my family to get a job, so I entered in a WhatsApp group related, but They send a lot of images of different job's opportunities but it's so bored to read each image and try to get what they are offering. So I created this script to find only the job's opportunities that I need. 

### Implementation Description
1. OCR Processing: I am using Pytesseract to implement the OCR algorhim 
2. Files Processing: I am using multithread implementation to iterate over the image files
3. Image Presentation: At the end, I'll show in your native image viewer the resulting images.
